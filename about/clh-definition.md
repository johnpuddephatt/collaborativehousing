The community-led housing sector definition for schemes that are truly “community-led” is:

- A requirement that the community must be integrally involved throughout the process in key decisions (what, where, for who). They don't necessarily have to initiate and manage the development process, or build the homes themselves, though some may do;
- A presumption in favour of community groups that are taking a long term formal role in ownership, management or stewardship of the homes; and
- A requirement that the benefits to the local area and/or specified community must be clearly defined and legally protected in perpetuity.
