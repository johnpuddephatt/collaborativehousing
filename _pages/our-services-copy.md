### The Collaborative Housing Alliance

A partnership offer for Local Authorities

# Why should local authorities be interested?

* **New finance**

Bringing alternative sources of finance to housing projects, such as citizen-lending.

* **Value for money**

Each pound invested generates higher value in return than conventional housing development.

* **Additionality**

Homes are built that would not otherwise be delivered.

* **Public Support**

Our workshop approaches generate public support for new housing, unlocking previously unavailable sites.

* **Identifying sites**

New land supply brought into the development process that would not have been possible through other means.

* **Social cohesion**

The generation of social capital has been proven to be higher through community-led models.

* **Climate targets**

Involving residents in the design of their homes results in more ambitious energy approaches, in part due to the persuit of lower monthly bills.

* **Responsive to change**

Neighbourhoods that are flexible to the changing needs of residents and those who require dedicated care services.If you're interested in learning more about what Collaborative Housing can do for you, [Book in a 15-minute chat](https://calendly.com/cohohub/15min) with one of our advisors.

## Here's how we might work with you:

### **Local authorities**

* **We can help support you ....**
* [**Housing Needs Surveys**](/uploads/housing-needs-survey-digital.pdf "housing-needs-survey-digital.pdf"): By helping your community or group understand the specific housing requirements of residents, an up-to-date Housing Needs Survey can help ensure that your new development best meets local needs. We are currently able to **OFFER A DISCOUNT** on our Housing Needs Survey service - **email** [**info@cohohub.org.uk**](mailto:info@cohohub.org.uk) **for more information.**
* 

### **Registered Providers (Housing Associations):**

* **Development opportunities:** We'll bring you a ready-formed group with a site opportunity to help you deliver affordable housing.
* **Negotiate partnership arrangements:** We'll help you to structure partnership agreements specific to community-led housing groups to share out the risk and benefits of the development.
* **Technical support:** We'll act as a professional intermediary between the group and the housing association, to facilitate the partnership.
