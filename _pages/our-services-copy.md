## Here's how we might work with you:

### **Local authorities**

* **We can help support you ....**
* [**Housing Needs Surveys**](/uploads/housing-needs-survey-digital.pdf "housing-needs-survey-digital.pdf"): By helping your community or group understand the specific housing requirements of residents, an up-to-date Housing Needs Survey can help ensure that your new development best meets local needs. We are currently able to **OFFER A DISCOUNT** on our Housing Needs Survey service - **email** [**info@cohohub.org.uk**](mailto:info@cohohub.org.uk) **for more information.**


* 

### **Registered Providers (Housing Associations):**

* **Development opportunities:** We'll bring you a ready-formed group with a site opportunity to help you deliver affordable housing.
* **Negotiate partnership arrangements:** We'll help you to structure partnership agreements specific to community-led housing groups to share out the risk and benefits of the development.
* **Technical support:** We'll act as a professional intermediary between the group and the housing association, to facilitate the partnership.
