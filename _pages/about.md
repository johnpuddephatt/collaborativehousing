The aim of Collaborative Housing is to support the development of a pipeline of community-led housing projects across the county.  The hub is a collaborative effort to ensure a coordinated and efficient approach, striking the right balance between a central point of expertise and practical local delivery. A structured and well-planned approach will be essential if momentum is to be maintained in delivering these projects.

> “The hub is in its early stages of development and partners are working together to develop the offer and identity”

The hub is in its early stages of development and partners are working together to develop the offer and identity local technical expertise that will be needed. We are interested in hearing from those who might be able to contribute expertise. We also wish to hear from groups who want to start such a local community-led housing project. If you are interested and want to know more please contact [info@communityfirstoxon.org](mailto:info@communityfirstoxon.org)

The hub is overseen by a Steering Group made up of senior managers/trustees from Community First Oxfordshire and Oxfordshire Community Land Trust. We are actively seeking partners in neighbouring counties in order to deliver collaborative housing advice across a wider area while ensuring that the service is strongly rooted in local connections. From the outset this is a collaborative venture which will evolve to meet changing needs.
