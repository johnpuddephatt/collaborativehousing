intro:
  subheading: "Collaborative Housing provides advice and support so people across
    the Thames Valley can plan, fund and build their own homes or work in partnership
    to do so.\n\nCOVID-19 UPDATE \n\nAlthough our office is currently closed we are
    still available to support groups so please do continue to get in touch with any
    questions. \n\nWhilst it is inevitable that the current situation will slow some
    aspects of projects, this period provides great opportunities for visioning and
    planning. We are still very happy to support through online meetings and are developing
    more online training support. \n"
  heading: We think houses made by the people who live in them create better homes
    and stronger communities
