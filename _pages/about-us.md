The aim of Collaborative Housing is to support the development of a pipeline of community-led housing projects across Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. The hub is a collaborative effort to ensure a coordinated and efficient approach, striking the right balance between a central point of expertise and practical local delivery.

> “With funding secured from government and our Communities Lead appointed, the Hub is now rolling out support for CLH groups across the Thames Valley.”

The hub is currently hosted by [Community First Oxfordshire](https://www.communityfirstoxon.org/) and is overseen by a steering group which includes those who have experience and in-depth knowledge of CLH. If you are interested in contributing your expertise to the steering group then please get in touch.

We would also love to hear from you if you are interested in starting a community-led housing project where you live. Likewise if you are a landowner or home-owner who might be interested in working with a community-led housing group.
