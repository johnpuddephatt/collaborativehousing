Here are two excellent resources for Local Authorities:

1. Co-operative Councils Innovation Network [Community-Led Housing: a Key Role for Local Authorities](http://www.councils.coop/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Community_Led_housing_Report_2017_web_version.pdf)

Launched on 24 January 2018, the Commissionâ€™s practical approach is aimed at promoting good practice and innovation to enable councils to work with communities to generate more affordable housing and make best use of government funding for community-led housing (CLH).

2. Housing Association Charitable Trust (HACT) [A Toolbox for Community-led Housing](https://www.hact.org.uk/toolbox-community-led-housing)

Aim: To produce a toolkit that will give more confidence to professionals and agencies to engage with community-led housing projects through the practical ways and means to do so.
