Collaborative Housing is a support Hub for community-led housing groups (e.g. community land trusts, co-operatives, co-housing, self-help housing, collective self-build, collective custom-build). We offer all the support necessary to take a group from initial concept to homes on the ground.

The Hub is hosted by [Community First Oxfordshire](https://www.communityfirstoxon.org/housing-community-planning/community-led-housing/) and supports groups across the Thames Valley (Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire).
