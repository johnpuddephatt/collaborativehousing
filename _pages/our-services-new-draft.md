Many people across the Thames Valley do not have access to good quality, secure and affordable housing. At Collaborative Housing, we think communities themselves are best-placed to identify their local housing need.   
  
Weâ€™re here to help bring together residents, housing associations, councils and landlords to collaborate and learn from each other to build better homes, and stronger places.

From exploring the possibilities, to the practicalities of funding, design and planning, our team of advisors are experts in the Thames Valley Housing sector, and they'll help you to discover and design your aims, build a project around them and translate that to different housing bodies.
