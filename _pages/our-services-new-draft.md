Many people across the Thames Valley do not have access to good quality, secure and affordable housing. At Collaborative Housing, we bring together residents, housing associations, councils and landlords to collaborate and learn from each other in order to build better homes, and stronger places.

From exploring the possibilities, to the practicalities of funding, design and planning, our team of advisors are experts in the Thames Valley Housing sector, and they'll help you to identify your local housing needs, design a project around them and translate that to different housing bodies.

From co-housing and community land trusts, to cooperatives and self-help housing, we want to encourage and support communities to find solutions that work for them.
