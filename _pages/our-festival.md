The aim of Collaborative Housing is to support the development of a pipeline of community-led housing projects across Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. The hub is a collaborative effort to ensure a coordinated and efficient approach, striking the right balance between a central point of expertise and practical local delivery.

The hub is hosted by Community First Oxfordshire and is overseen by a steering group which includes those who have experience and in-depth knowledge of CLH. If you are interested in contributing your expertise to the steering group then please get in touch.
