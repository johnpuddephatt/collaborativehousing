We know the the early stages of a community-led housing project can often be the most challenging. 

To helps make things easier we are able - while funds allow - to offer up to £1k ‘get going’ funding via our [**AGILE FUND**](/uploads/agile-fund-flyer-digital.pdf "agile-fund-flyer-digital.pdf")**.**

It is intended to cover the cost of things like:

* Community engagement costs (e.g. publicity materials, Zoom licence) 
* Development of a website 
* Legal advice on governance 
* Incorporation costs 
* Training 
* Surveys etc.
