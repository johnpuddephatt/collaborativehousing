We know the the early stages of a community-led housing project can often be the most challenging.

To helps make things easier we are able - while funds allow - to offer up to £1k ‘get going’ funding via our [**AGILE FUND**](/uploads/agile-fund-flyer-digital.pdf "agile-fund-flyer-digital.pdf")**.**

Sadly, the Agile fund has now closed. Collaborative Housing are working  together with national funders to secure other sources of support. Please get in touch. We will help make contacts.
