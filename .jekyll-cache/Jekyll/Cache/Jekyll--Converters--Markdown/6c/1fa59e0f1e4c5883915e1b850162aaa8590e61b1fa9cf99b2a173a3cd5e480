I"ù<p>Oxford City Council commissioned Community First Oxfordshire, Oxfordshire Community Land Trust and Oxfordshire Community Foundation to undertake a research project to explore how community-led housing could be delivered sustainably within Oxford City.</p>

<p>The study identifies a range of feasible delivery routes for community-led housing schemes and identifies the support that is needed if community-led housing is to be a real option for Oxford residents. This report is also relevant for community-led housing in other high land value areas across the Thames Valley.</p>
