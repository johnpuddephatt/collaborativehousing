<p><a href="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk/about.html">Collaborative Housing</a> is a comprehensive support Hub for community-led housing groups (e.g. community land trusts, co-operatives, co-housing, self-help housing, collective self-build, collective custom-build). We offer all the support necessary to take a group from initial concept to homes on the ground. The Hub is hosted by <a href="https://www.communityfirstoxon.org/housing-community-planning/community-led-housing/">Community First Oxfordshire</a> and supports groups across the Thames Valley (Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire).</p>
