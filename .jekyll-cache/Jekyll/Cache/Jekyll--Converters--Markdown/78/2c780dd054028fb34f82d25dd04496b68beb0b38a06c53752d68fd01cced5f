I"?<p>The term ‘community led housing’ is commonly used to describe homes that are developed and/or managed by local people or residents in not-for-profit organisational structures. This can include residents influencing or controlling the design process, full community control of the built housing and amenities, full community ownership of the property on completion, community control over who lives in the development, rental and sales prices fixed in perpetuity by covenants in ownership contracts, and ongoing community management. Community groups often actively build communities as well as housing and so create resilient mutually supportive neighbourhoods. Community led housing is designed and managed by the people who will live in the homes and often also owned by an entity that is controlled by the community.</p>
