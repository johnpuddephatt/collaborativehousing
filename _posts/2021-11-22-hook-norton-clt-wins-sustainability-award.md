We are delighted that Hook Norton CLT won the award in the 2021 National CLT awards 'What a wonderful world' category for sustainability.

Collaborative Housing nominated HNCLT for the way they have used every  opportunity  to create a sustainable scheme; not just in the construction but for the people who will live in the homes and for the wider community. Features include 

* Buildings designed to Passivhaus standards with rooftop solar PV panels, and air source heat pumps
* A community hub which includes home working space, a sustainable café and a library of things as well as a shared laundry for residents and guest rooms so people can ‘right size’ their homes whilst still having room for family and friend to come and stay
* Shared growing space and greenhouse
* An electric car club on site
* Carbon offsetting through tree planting.
* Working with the Oxford Low carbon hub on a shared micro grid

Many congratulations to Hooky!
