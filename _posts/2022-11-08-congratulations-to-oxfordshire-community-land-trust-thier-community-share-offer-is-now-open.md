Oxfordshire Community Land Trust is extremely excited and proud to announce that its Community Share Offer is now open for social investment.  
   
 As you may know, its first development at Crofts Court in Dean Court, Cumnor Parish just west of Oxford will provide 8 much needed community-led affordable homes for those on the Vale of White Horse Housing List and with a strong local connection.

It was a monumental achievement by the trust getting this site out of the ground in June this year and it's already making excellent progress to welcome tenants by June next year. However, as you will be aware, interest rates continue to climb and so despite generous funding from the Vale and Future Oxfordshire Partnership, the trust still relies on and is vulnerable to its construction loan's interest rates increasing further. It therefore needs help to insulate itself from higher commercial lending rates through more affordable finance terms by replacing some of its construction loan with social investment.  
   
 That's where hopefully social investors and organisations can step in and take a stake in fairer more sustainable housing for Oxfordshire! The trust is now offering Community Shares at a value of £1, offered in multiples of 250, with a minimum investment of £250 and a maximum of £50,000. The Community Shares will carry a target maximum interest rate of 3% and it needs to raise £500,000 by 28 February 2023.
