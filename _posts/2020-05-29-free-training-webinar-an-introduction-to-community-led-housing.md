This course is supported by Wokingham Borough Council Adult Community Learning. We are all aware that houses are currently being built throughout the Thames Valley on a large scale, but are they really affordable or accessible to people growing up or working in your village or community?

Community-led housing is housing built on a not-for-profit basis by a community to meet its own needs. There are a number of different approaches to community-led housing, all resulting in homes built for the community but with different processes and levels of involvement.

This short online introductory course will enable participants to understand the differences between the various models of community-led housing. It is aimed at Parish & Town Councillors, land owners and anyone from both rural and urban communities interested in exploring the options for providing affordable housing for people with a connection to their community. Rural exception sites are now quite well-known and at this session we will examine them in the context of other options, including self-build, community land trusts and co-operatives.
