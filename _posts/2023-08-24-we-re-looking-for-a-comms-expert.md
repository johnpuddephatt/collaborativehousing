Despite the very wet weather Hook Norton CLT were pleased to celebrate the progress with their new affordable and sustainable homes for local people in Hook Norton. The event was well attended by the community and the partners including the builder Greencore Homes, partner Housing Association Soha, and Cherwell District Council who transferred the homes.
