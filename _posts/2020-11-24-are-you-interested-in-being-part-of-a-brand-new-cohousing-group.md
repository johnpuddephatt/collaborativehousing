**Cohousing groups are people who come together to design and plan their own small neighbourhood. Each resident will have their own private home and schemes are designed to allow for lots of social interaction through shared space such as a common house and gardens.**

**A new cohousing group is forming in Eynsham, West Oxfordshire with a view to seeking potential land on the Salt Cross Garden Village for the project.**

**Please do let us know if you are interested in finding out more. We have a workshop for group members on Saturday 28th November.**
