We are delighted that Oxfordshire CLT have now opened their new housing project at Crofts Court. The scheme comprises of 8 affordable, 1 and 2 bedroom flats and the tenants have formed a management co-op to take control of how the homes are managed. 
This is a trailblazer for Oxfordshire and the results of many years hard work by the CLT.
