Thanks to the 22 people from across Berkshire who came to Collaborative Housing's **Introduction to Community-led Housing webinar** yesterday. Hosted by Tim Parry from Connecting Communities in Berkshire, the session was led by our Communities Lead, Fiona Brown. 

Fiona covered topics such as what is community led housing; different models and approaches; key steps to a successful project; and where to find advice and support. Claire Milne then took us from theory to practice, talking about her experience (from the positive to the more challenging!) of developing a project with the Windsor, Ascot and Maidenhead Community Land Trust. â€‹A lively question and answer session followed, going into more depth on topics such as different CLH models; the Passivhaus standard; and building on Rural Exception Sites.

**Collaborative Housing will be holding more of these webinars in the near future. Keep an eye on our website and social media....**
