We are delighted that Oxfordshire County Council, Cherwell District Council, Oxford City Council, South Oxfordshire District Council, Vale of White Horse District Council and West Oxfordshire District Council are supporting our service through a Service Level Agreement. We are looking forward to building our partnership with them to create a positive enabling environment for community-led housing across Oxfordshire.
