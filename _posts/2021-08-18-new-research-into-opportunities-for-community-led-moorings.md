Coho Hub in conjunction with Oxfordshire Community Land Trust has been asked to carry out research into the opportunities and viability for community-led moorings on the waterways of Oxford. Earlier this year we held some events for local boaters exploring the opportunities and hearing from community -led moorings groups around the country and it was clear there was considerable interest in the concept.

The researchers have recently launched a survey so if you know anyone currently living in a boat in Oxford we would love to hear from them. The survey can be found here:

The survey closes on the 25th and anyone completing will be entered into a draw for a Â£30 voucher for Sovereign Wharf chandlery.
