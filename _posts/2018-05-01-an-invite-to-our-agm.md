Our 2018 Annual General Meeting will be held in Oxford in just a few weeks.

### Want to become a Director of OCLT?

To join our merry band of housing boffins all you have to do is get someone to propose you to the board. Applications will be checked before the AGM to make sure candidates meet our criteria and then it will be put to a vote on the evening of the AGM.

Sound good? You can fill out the application here and then email it back to membership@oclt.org.uk.
