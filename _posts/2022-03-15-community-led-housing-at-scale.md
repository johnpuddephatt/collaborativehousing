On the 2nd March Collaborative Housing joined forces with Eastern Community Homes and East Midlands Community-led Housing to host an online event exploring the growth region known as the Oxford-Cambridge Arc and the opportunities for community led approaches. The event was introduced by Councillor Barry Wood, Leader of Cherwell District Council and included case studies from Graven Hill , the UKs largest self build project and Kennet Garden Village where affordable housing is being transferred to a local CLT.

The recording of the event can be viewed here [YouTube channel](https://email.cambsacre.org.uk/e3t/Btc/DN+113/d15vh104/VWx28h8QR7TdVh9Sx74lzy57W28qdJZ4Gmp7FN4sL4cZ3q3npV1-WJV7CgP4gVBmfnY99pbGnN93sQDmV4pGCV6R9yM4CkC2gN5S156dsHyJzVFJCFR74qS0tW5dnm092dBRytW6WQMhh9bCwx9Mk_MjgbXRn2W3g8yZX2qpTZMW7ySh0D8NYjp5W7TgWMS6SJZbnW5zGd3r97t-PZW66Dd767vcPPSW6CMn9X7CDHXZW4Fj6bK3Zpz40W91yPlZ6cLDWtW3WfsWG2Sr8RsW4vD1CD5lfN0wW8zmvx_8psrpvVXvkVj1ScP6qVWR5Qg2nvv0VW7Xp1C769ZsJP36gq1)![graven](https://info.cambsacre.org.uk/hubfs/graven_hill.jpg)
