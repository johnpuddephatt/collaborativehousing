We are thrilled to announce that Collaborative Housing is holding a Thames-Valley Community-Led Housing Festival from the 10 to 14 May 2021.

Many people across the Thames Valley do not have access to good quality, secure and affordable housing. At Collaborative Housing, we bring together residents, housing associations, councils and landlords to collaborate and learn from each other in order to build better homes, and stronger places.

In the last year we have witnessed the growth of community led housing and action groups across the Thames Valley Region.

We will be exploring topics such as Affordable Housing, Building Partnerships, Sustainable Building, Retrofitting, Diversity in Community-led Housing, and the impact of the pandemic on how we live in our homes and neighbourhoods.'
