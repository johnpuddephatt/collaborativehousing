Hook Norton CLT has  a new blog on the Hook Norton CLT website from Luke Fallon, an A level student at The Warriner School. Luke lives locally and is interested in community housing and the environment and is hoping to study Architecture and Environmental Design at uni. The blog is great and he organised a survey of young people to obtain their views on the lack of affordable housing.
