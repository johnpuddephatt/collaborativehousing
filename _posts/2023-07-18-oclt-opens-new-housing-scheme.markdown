We are delighted that Oxfordshire CLT has now taken the keys for the County's first community -led housing project in many years.  Crofts Court in Botley on the outskirts of Oxford comprises of 8 affordable one and two bed apartments which have been let to people with a local connection to the area. Tenants have formed a management co-op to control how the homes will be maintained and managed. 

Many congratulations to OCLT for this success -we know it has been very hard work but you have lit the way for other communities wanting to provide homes for their communities.
