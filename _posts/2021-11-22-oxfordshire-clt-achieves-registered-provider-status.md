OCLT has been recognised by the government (through the Regulator of Social Housing) as a Registered Provider of Social Housing (RP). This is a tremendous achievement, especially for a small organisation. It means that the CLT will need to meet the the Economic and Consumer Regulatory Standards which include Finance and Governance, Tenant Satisfaction and Strong Neighbourhoods and Communities. 

Crucially achieving RP status means that OCLT can now draw down the funding awarded earlier this year for the 8 flats for affordable rent  at Dean Court in Botley, Oxford.  Work on site to build these vital homes for local people will now begin in 2022.  

This is very good news for the Community Led Homes sector in Oxfordshire and puts OCLT in a strong position to support and develop future projects. 

If you are interested in supporting them you can become a member for a small membership fee.    www.oclt.org.uk
