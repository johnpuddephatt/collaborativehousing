&lt;p&gt;After two years of hard work, a planning application for 31 homes for sale and rent will be submitted to South Oxfordshire District Council in October. A public exhibition (an exemplary example of social distancing!) was held on the weekend of 5 September. 122 turned up at Thame Town hall to view the site plans and discuss them with members of the CLT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Austin, a member of the CLT commented, ‘the event convinced us that we are on the right track. Many attendees explained the difficulties they were facing both in terms of cost and availability of Thame housing. There is a clear and desperate need to help the “missing middle”- those who cannot access social housing but cannot afford market prices. A particular interest was shown in the houses for proposed sale. Everybody we spoke to understood that all the properties would remain affordable and that resale of purchased properties would be controlled, via a resale price covenant, to ensure that this was the case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While concern was expressed by some residents from the surrounding area about traffic and access, the CLT is endeavouring to find solutions through ongoing consultation with Sustrans and Oxfordshire County Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob added: ‘A prime motivation of the Trust is to help keep Thame families together by providing affordable accommodation and so mitigate the drift of, particularly, young families out of the town. The demand, as shown by our housing needs survey, is greater than can be supplied by one site. We need the authorities to make the availability of land for Community Land Trusts easier. We know that no one site will be perfect but the cause is.’&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Thame Community Land Trust was founded in 2018 with the goal of building genuinely affordable housing to buy or rent which meets the needs of local people.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//uploads/img_20200904_154419.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//uploads/img_20200904_154419.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">New research report - Community Land Trust options at the Oxfordshire Cotswolds Garden Village</title><link href="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//2020/07/07/new-research-report-community-land-trust-options-at-the-oxfordshire-cotswolds-garden-village.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New research report - Community Land Trust options at the Oxfordshire Cotswolds Garden Village" /><published>2020-07-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//2020/07/07/new-research-report-community-land-trust-options-at-the-oxfordshire-cotswolds-garden-village</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//2020/07/07/new-research-report-community-land-trust-options-at-the-oxfordshire-cotswolds-garden-village.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;West Oxfordshire District Council (WODC) recently commissioned Collaborative Housing to undertake a&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.westoxon.gov.uk/media/avxefy30/community-land-trust-scoping-report-june-2020.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Exploring the options for a Community Land Trust at the Oxfordshire Cotswolds Garden Village &quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;scoping report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;that looked into options for delivery and stewardship approaches for a Community Land Trust (CLT) at the Oxfordshire Cotswolds Garden Village (OCGV).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by Charlie Fisher, the research found a strong desire within the local community for engagement and control through establishing a CLT for long-term stewardship and ownership of assets on the OCGV site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report sets out options for CLT delivery, ownership and management at the Garden Village. Recommendations for options on ownership, identity, legal and finance include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Development of a new stewardship body using the CLT legal definition found in the 2008 Housing and Regeneration Act&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incorporating ‘Village Trust’ or ‘Garden Village Trust’ into the name to establish a clear identity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring there is sufficient flexibility for wider community involvement beyond the OCGV site residents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The use of large-scale forms of legacy ownership to adequately meet the ‘Garden City Principles’ and ‘Garden Communities Programme Key Qualities’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incubating the CLT within partner organisations to help develop skills and administrative processes in the initial years, transitioning to independent development and management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prototyping new housing models and tenures with local cohousing groups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Undertake further exploratory work on diverse long-term income streams and the impact these would have on the sitewide business plan, including the land value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborative Housing believes that these recommendations have wider implications for the delivery of CLTs on other strategic sites allocated within the adopted WODC Local Plan 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From August to September 2020 WODC will undertake public consultation on the Area Action Plan for the Garden Village.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">West Oxfordshire District Council (WODC) recently commissioned Collaborative Housing to undertake a scoping report that looked into options for delivery and stewardship approaches for a Community Land Trust (CLT) at the Oxfordshire Cotswolds Garden Village (OCGV).</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//uploads/capture.JPG" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//uploads/capture.JPG" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting the ball rolling…</title><link href="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//2020/06/05/getting-the-ball-rolling.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting the ball rolling..." /><published>2020-06-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//2020/06/05/getting-the-ball-rolling</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//2020/06/05/getting-the-ball-rolling.html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the 22 people from across Berkshire who came to Collaborative Housing’s &lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Community-led Housing webinar&lt;/strong&gt; yesterday. Hosted by Tim Parry from Connecting Communities in Berkshire, the session was led by our Communities Lead, Fiona Brown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiona covered topics such as what is community led housing; different models and approaches; key steps to a successful project; and where to find advice and support. Claire Milne then took us from theory to practice, talking about her experience (from the positive to the more challenging!) of developing a project with the Windsor, Ascot and Maidenhead Community Land Trust. ​A lively question and answer session followed, going into more depth on topics such as different CLH models; the Passivhaus standard; and building on Rural Exception Sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative Housing will be holding more of these webinars in the near future.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday 4th June, 11am - midday: online webinar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To book your FREE place: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ccberks.wufoo.com/forms/community-led-housing-webinar/&quot; title=&quot;https://ccberks.wufoo.com/forms/community-led-housing-webinar/&quot;&gt;https://ccberks.wufoo.com/forms/community-led-housing-webinar/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is supported by Wokingham Borough Council Adult Community Learning. We are all aware that houses are currently being built throughout the Thames Valley on a large scale, but are they really affordable or accessible to people growing up or working in your village or community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community-led housing is housing built on a not-for-profit basis by a community to meet its own needs. There are a number of different approaches to community-led housing, all resulting in homes built for the community but with different processes and levels of involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short online introductory course will enable participants to understand the differences between the various models of community-led housing. It is aimed at Parish &amp;amp; Town Councillors, land owners and anyone from both rural and urban communities interested in exploring the options for providing affordable housing for people with a connection to their community. Rural exception sites are now quite well-known and at this session we will examine them in the context of other options, including self-build, community land trusts and co-operatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Connecting Communities in Berkshire and Collaborative Housing Hub are running a FREE short online course on community-led housing in June.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//uploads/sticker.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//uploads/sticker.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Introducing our Communities Lead - Fiona Brown</title><link href="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//2020/05/13/introducing-our-communities-lead-fiona-brown.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing our Communities Lead - Fiona Brown" /><published>2020-05-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//2020/05/13/introducing-our-communities-lead-fiona-brown</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk//2020/05/13/introducing-our-communities-lead-fiona-brown.html">&lt;p&gt;Fiona has over 30 years’ experience in social housing and has worked in housing management, strategy and policy work and in enabling affordable housing development within a local authority context.
