We are looking forward to sharing our newest report with you.It explores community-led moorings and the possibilities this can open up.

Living in Oxford is expensive and homes are in high demand. This has led many to look at their options. For some this might be to live on a boat. Living on a floating home sounds romantic and is great way of living close to nature. It is however also a very physical way of life that creates a strong community that can be called on when help is needed.

This community is now keen to explore possibilities that extends to Community-led moorings that can offer support but also expand to better maintenance of waterways that would help biodiversity and sustainability in the long-term. 

Boaters in other cities and along other rivers that are interlinked, are also exploring similar ways of launching Community-led approach to better manage rivers, Canals, Boat and moorings.

Please join us to hear the latest report and that relates to Oxford and beyond.
