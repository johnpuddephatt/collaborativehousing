**We are holding a FREE online (Zoom) session for communities across Oxfordshire on Thursday 22 October @ 2pm**

Are you a parish council, neighbourhood planning group or other community group interested in finding out more about community led housing? Then why not drop in and find out about:

* What is community led housing and what are the benefits?
* Examples of community led housing in Oxfordshire
* Starting from scratch -setting up a community led housing group
* How can Collaborative Housing help local community groups?
* The experience from one local group in setting up a community led housing group and delivering their first project.

There will be an opportunity to ask questions and to have a follow up call to talk in detail about your own situation. The session will be approximately one and half hours.
