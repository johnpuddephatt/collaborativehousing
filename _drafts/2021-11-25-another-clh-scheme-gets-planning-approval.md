Congratulations to Thame CLT on gaining planning approval at the SODC planning committee on the 24th November 2021. The site, close to the centre of Thame has come forward as a rural exception site for 31 affordable homes, 16 for affordable rent and 15 for discount market sale.  A housing needs survey undertaken in 2019 showed a high need for homes that were truly affordable to people on local incomes with a strong connection to Thame. The homes have been  designed by Transition by Design, to passivhaus standards.  We believe this is the first development of its kind in the town. 

The hub has been supporting Thame CLT to get to this stage and with the help of a successful bid to the Community Led Housing Fund can now support the group to move forward to the next stage of detailed design and tendering for the build contract.
