OxCLT move to the next stage!

It has been a long and difficult journey to get to this point, however the building can now begin.

This give community-led housing hope.;-)                          More importantly though, it will provide homes to people on the Vale of White Horse District Councilâ€™s Housing Register. Preference will be given to people with a connection to the local area, Dean Court, Cumnor Parish and the immediately adjacent parishes in VWHDC. It is intended that residents will manage the flats as a co-operative. For more information [please follow this link](https://www.oclt.org.uk/news/)
