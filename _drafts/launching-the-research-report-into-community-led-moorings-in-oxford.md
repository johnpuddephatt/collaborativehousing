You may remember us advertising a survey last year that helped inform this research and we are delighted to say we now have a final report on how community led moorings could be delivered in Oxford.  We believe this is the first research of its kind in the country and the finding apply beyond Oxford to all areas where there could be better mooring provision. 

The final report can be found here..

The report demonstrates the clear need for more permanent and temporary mooring sites as well as better facilities for boaters such as access to water and waste disposal. In an unaffordable housing market, affordable and well manged moorings can provide a housing solution for some. There is growing interest in these being community- led where the benefits could be affordable moorings for the local community held by the community, capturing the enthusiasm of many boaters to preserve the biodiversity of the river and canal and improving areas along the towpath for visitors. 

We are holding an online event to discuss the findings of the report and the next steps to build up the Boaters community and hopefully deliver on the recommendations in the report. Book you slot now by visiting ....

Collaborative housing would like to say a big thank you to Oxford City Council and Oxfordshire Community Land Trust who helped fund this important research.
