On the 2nd March Collaborative Housing joined forces with Eastern Community Homes and East Midlands Community-led Housing homes to host an online event looking at the growth region known as the Oxford-Cambridge Arc and the opportunities for community led approaches. The event was introduced by Councillor Barry Wood, Leader of Cherwell District Council and included case studies from Graven Hill , the UKs largest self build project and Kennet Garden Village where affordable housing is being transferred to a local CLT.
